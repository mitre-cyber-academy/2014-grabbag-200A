Name: Power Panels of Hanoi

Description: The user is presented with a program that is almost like the infamous game Towers of Hanoi. They are to transfer the power from
one panel to the other while following a specific set of rules. Rules that are included in the program are as follows:


*************************************************************** DIRECTIONS ****************************************************

The are three panels that contain five systems each. The systems are numbered based on their level of power consumption.
The systems of power range from 1 (being the lowest) to 5 (being the highest).

Goal: Activate the power of all 5 systems of the bottom pane by redirecting power among the three panels.

Restrictions:

	- You can only redirect one system at a time.
	- You can only redirect the lowest power system on a panel to another panel.
	(Example: If the lowest system activated on a panel is 2, you must move the power of system 2 before the higher systems like 3, 4, or 5)

	- You can only redirect power to a panel if it is of a lesser power than the systems already stored in the panel.
	(Example: You can redirect power of magnitude 1 or 2 to a panel that has power 3 activated, but you cannot redirect the power of system 4 or 5)

Good luck!

Once they transfer all the systems to the correct panel, they will be able to unlock the key.
